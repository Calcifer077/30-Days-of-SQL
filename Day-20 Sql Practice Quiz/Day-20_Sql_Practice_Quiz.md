### üîç Overview

Today‚Äôs session will reinforce your understanding of key SQL concepts, including:

- Aggregate functions and joins.
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
- Window functions and their applications.
- Subqueries and set operations.

You‚Äôll also attempt a quiz to assess your grasp on these advanced topics.

### üßë‚Äçüíª Practice Scenarios

#### 1. Aggregates and Joins

Write a query to calculate the total sales revenue for each product category in the last year, including the category name and total revenue. Use joins and aggregate functions.

**Hint:** You‚Äôll need to join the `products` table with the `sales` table and group by the category.

```sql
SELECT p.category_name, SUM(s.amount) AS total_revenue
FROM products p
JOIN sales s ON p.product_id = s.product_id
WHERE s.sale_date >= '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY p.category_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

#### 2. CTEs and Window Functions

Use a CTE to create a temporary result set of customers who made purchases in the last month. Then, use a window function to rank these customers by total spend.

**Hint:** Combine CTEs and `RANK()`.

```sql
WITH RecentPurchases AS (
    SELECT customer_id, SUM(amount) AS total_spent
    FROM sales
    WHERE sale_date >= '2024-12-01'
    GROUP BY customer_id
)
SELECT customer_id, total_spent,
       RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total_spent DESC) AS rank
FROM RecentPurchases;
```

#### 3. Subqueries and Set Operations

Find customers who purchased from both the `electronics` and `furniture` categories.

**Hint:** Use `INTERSECT` between two subqueries.

```sql
SELECT customer_id
FROM sales
WHERE product_id IN (
    SELECT product_id
    FROM products
    WHERE category_name = 'electronics'
)
INTERSECT
SELECT customer_id
FROM sales
WHERE product_id IN (
    SELECT product_id
    FROM products
    WHERE category_name = 'furniture'
);
```

### üéØ Quiz - Day 20

#### 1. Multiple Choice

1. Which SQL clause is used to define a CTE?
   - a) SELECT
   - b) WITH
   - c) AS
   - d) CREATE

2. What does the `ROW_NUMBER()` function do?
   - a) Counts the number of rows in a table.
   - b) Assigns a unique sequential number to rows within a partition.
   - c) Sorts rows in descending order.
   - d) Removes duplicate rows from a result set.

#### 2. Query Challenges

1. Write a query using a recursive CTE to calculate the factorial of 5.
2. Use a window function to find the second-highest total sales amount in the `sales` table.
3. Combine multiple CTEs to identify top-performing products by region.
