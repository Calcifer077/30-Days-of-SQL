### Practice Exercises 🔧

Here are some practice problems based on the SQL concepts you’ve learned so far:

#### Problem 1: Total Sales Per Region
Use the `sales` table to calculate total sales for each region and only include regions with sales greater than $10,000.

**Table: sales**

| salesperson | region | sales_amount |
|-------------|--------|--------------|
| Alice       | North  | 5000         |
| Bob         | South  | 7000         |
| Alice       | North  | 3000         |
| Bob         | South  | 2000         |
| Carol       | East   | 8000         |

**Expected Output:**

| region | total_sales |
|--------|-------------|
| South  | 12000       |

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT region, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY region
HAVING SUM(sales_amount) > 10000;
```

#### Problem 2: Average Score by Class
From a `students` table, find the average score for each class, but only include classes with an average score above 75.

**Table: students**

| class  | student_name | score |
|--------|--------------|-------|
| A      | John         | 85    |
| A      | Mary         | 90    |
| B      | Jake         | 70    |
| B      | Emily        | 75    |
| A      | Steve        | 95    |

**Expected Output:**

| class | average_score |
|-------|---------------|
| A     | 90.0          |

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT class, AVG(score) AS average_score
FROM students
GROUP BY class
HAVING AVG(score) > 75;
```

#### Problem 3: Customer Orders
Using an `orders` table, find customers who have placed more than 3 orders and whose total order value exceeds $5000.

**Table: orders**

| customer_id | order_id | order_total |
|-------------|----------|-------------|
| 1           | 101      | 2000        |
| 2           | 102      | 1500        |
| 1           | 103      | 3000        |
| 3           | 104      | 800         |
| 2           | 105      | 2000        |
| 1           | 106      | 1000        |

**Expected Output:**

| customer_id | total_orders | total_value |
|-------------|--------------|-------------|
| 1           | 3            | 6000        |

**Query:**
```sql
SELECT customer_id, COUNT(order_id) AS total_orders, SUM(order_total) AS total_value
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(order_id) > 3 AND SUM(order_total) > 5000;
```

### Quiz Questions 🕵

Test your understanding with these questions:

#### Question 1: Identify Invalid Queries
Which of the following queries will result in an error?

1. ```sql
   SELECT region, SUM(sales_amount)
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY region
   HAVING SUM(sales_amount) > 10000;
   ```
2. ```sql
   SELECT region
   FROM sales
   HAVING SUM(sales_amount) > 10000;
   ```
3. ```sql
   SELECT region, AVG(sales_amount)
   FROM sales
   GROUP BY region
   HAVING AVG(sales_amount) > 4000;
   ```

#### Question 2: True or False
The `HAVING` clause can only be used with aggregate functions.

- [ ] True
- [ ] False

#### Question 3: Fill in the Blanks
Complete the query to find regions with total sales greater than $15,000:

```sql
SELECT region, ________(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY region
HAVING ________(sales_amount) > 15000;
```

---

### Answer Key 🔐

#### Question 1: Identify Invalid Queries
- Answer: Query 2 will result in an error because the `HAVING` clause requires a `GROUP BY` clause.

#### Question 2: True or False
- Answer: True

#### Question 3: Fill in the Blanks
- Answer:

```sql
SELECT region, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY region
HAVING SUM(sales_amount) > 15000;
```
