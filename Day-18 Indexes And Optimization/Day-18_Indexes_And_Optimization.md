### 🔎 Overview

Indexes are data structures that improve the speed of data retrieval. However, they come at a cost: increased storage and slower write operations. Effective query optimization involves leveraging indexes and writing efficient queries.

---

### 📘 Understanding Indexes

#### 1. Types of Indexes

- **Primary Index**: Automatically created on primary keys.
- **Unique Index**: Ensures unique values in the indexed column(s).
- **Clustered Index**: Sorts and stores data rows in the table based on the key values.
- **Non-Clustered Index**: Stores pointers to the actual data rows.
- **Composite Index**: Indexes multiple columns.
- **Full-Text Index**: Optimized for text search.

#### 2. How Indexes Work

Indexes are like a book’s table of contents. Instead of scanning the entire table, the database uses the index to find rows faster.

**Example Without Index**:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = 12345;
```

**Example With Index**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_customer_id ON orders(customer_id);
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id = 12345;
```

#### 3. Creating and Managing Indexes

**Creating an Index**:

```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_column_name ON table_name(column_name);
```

**Dropping an Index**:

```sql
DROP INDEX idx_column_name;
```

**Viewing Existing Indexes** (PostgreSQL Example):

```sql
SELECT *
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE tablename = 'table_name';
```

### 🔧 Query Optimization Techniques

#### 1. Analyzing Query Plans

Use the `EXPLAIN` keyword to understand how the database executes a query.

**Example**:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE order_date > '2024-01-01';
```

#### 2. Avoiding Common Pitfalls

- **Avoid SELECT**: Specify only required columns.
- **Index Usage**: Ensure indexes are used for filtering and joining.
- **Avoid Functions on Indexed Columns**:

```sql
-- Avoid
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE YEAR(order_date) = 2024;

-- Use
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01' AND order_date < '2025-01-01';
```

#### 3. Optimizing Joins and Subqueries

- Use indexed columns in `JOIN` conditions.
- Avoid unnecessary subqueries; use `WITH` (CTEs) where applicable.

**Example**:

```sql
-- Inefficient Subquery
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE customer_id IN (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM customers
    WHERE country = 'USA'
);

-- Optimized Query
WITH US_Customers AS (
    SELECT customer_id
    FROM customers
    WHERE country = 'USA'
)
SELECT *
FROM orders
JOIN US_Customers
ON orders.customer_id = US_Customers.customer_id;
```

### 🔄 Best Practices for Indexing

- **Index Selectively**: Index columns frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, or `ORDER BY` clauses.
- **Monitor Index Usage**: Use query execution plans to ensure indexes are utilized.
- **Avoid Over-Indexing**: Too many indexes can degrade performance for `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `DELETE` operations.
- **Regular Maintenance**: Rebuild or reorganize fragmented indexes.

---

### 🔟 Hands-On Challenge

1. Create a non-clustered index on the `order_date` column of the `orders` table and measure query performance with and without the index.
2. Use `EXPLAIN` to analyze a query and identify optimization opportunities.
3. Optimize a query using a composite index.

---

### 💻 Exercises - Day 18

#### ✅ Exercise: Level 1

1. Create an index on the `customer_id` column of the `orders` table.
2. Use `EXPLAIN` to compare query plans for a query with and without an index.
3. Write a query to find all orders placed in 2024, and optimize it using an index.

#### 🚀 Exercise: Level 2

1. Implement a composite index on `customer_id` and `order_date` in the `orders` table. Write a query to retrieve orders for a specific customer within a date range.
2. Use a query plan to analyze the performance of a complex join query and suggest optimizations.
3. Create and use a full-text index to search for keywords in a `comments` column.
