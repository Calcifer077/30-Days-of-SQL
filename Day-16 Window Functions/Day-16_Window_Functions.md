### üîç Overview
Window Functions are SQL functions that operate on a set of rows related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions, they do not collapse rows but instead add calculated values to each row. Window Functions are especially useful for:

- Ranking rows.
- Calculating moving averages.
- Retrieving values from other rows.
- Performing cumulative calculations.

### üìò Key Window Functions
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the most commonly used Window Functions:

| Function          | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ROW_NUMBER       | Assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition.                            |
| RANK             | Assigns a rank to rows in a partition, with gaps in ranking for ties.                      |
| DENSE_RANK       | Similar to RANK but without gaps in ranking for ties.                                       |
| NTILE            | Divides rows into a specified number of groups and assigns each row a group ID.            |
| LEAD and LAG     | Retrieve values from the next or previous row in a partition.                              |
| FIRST_VALUE      | Retrieves the first value in a partition.                                                  |
| LAST_VALUE       | Retrieves the last value in a partition.                                                   |

### Syntax üîß
Each Window Function is used with the `OVER` clause:

```sql
SELECT column_name,
       window_function() OVER ([PARTITION BY column_name] [ORDER BY column_name]) AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```

---

### üí° Practical Examples

#### 1. ROW_NUMBER
Assign a unique number to each employee within their department:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
FROM employees;
```

#### 2. RANK and DENSE_RANK
Rank employees by salary within their department:

```sql
-- RANK Example
SELECT employee_id, department_id, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;

-- DENSE_RANK Example
SELECT employee_id, department_id, salary,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees;
```

#### 3. NTILE
Divide employees into 4 salary quartiles:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id, salary,
       NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary) AS quartile
FROM employees;
```

#### 4. LEAD and LAG
Retrieve the previous and next employee‚Äôs salary:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, salary,
       LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS prev_salary,
       LEAD(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS next_salary
FROM employees;
```

#### 5. FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE
Get the first and last salary in each department:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id, salary,
       FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary) AS min_salary,
       LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS max_salary
FROM employees;
```

#### 6. OVER Clause
The `OVER` clause defines the window or set of rows that the window function operates on. It can include the following components:

1. **PARTITION BY**: Divides the result set into partitions.
2. **ORDER BY**: Specifies the order of rows within each partition.
3. **ROWS or RANGE**: Defines the frame of rows for calculations.

```sql
SELECT employee_id, salary,
       SUM(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary) AS cumulative_salary
FROM employees;

```

### üîß Best Practices
- **Use PARTITION BY Wisely**: Partition data meaningfully to get accurate results.
- **Optimize Performance**: Combine Window Functions with indexed columns to improve query speed.
- **Understand ROWS vs RANGE**: Be clear on how the window frame affects calculations.
- **Avoid Overlapping Calculations**: Reduce redundancy by minimizing the number of Window Functions in a query.

### üéØ Hands-On Challenge

1. Use ROW_NUMBER to identify the top 3 earners in each department.
2. Use RANK and DENSE_RANK to rank employees based on their performance scores.
3. Calculate a running total of sales using a Window Function.
4. Use LEAD and LAG to compare a product‚Äôs sales with its previous and next month‚Äôs performance.
5. Retrieve the first and last transaction amounts for each customer using FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE.
