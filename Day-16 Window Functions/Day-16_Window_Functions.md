### üîç Overview
Window Functions are SQL functions that operate on a set of rows related to the current row. Unlike aggregate functions, they do not collapse rows but instead add calculated values to each row. Window Functions are especially useful for:

- Ranking rows.
- Calculating moving averages.
- Retrieving values from other rows.
- Performing cumulative calculations.

### üìò Key Window Functions
Here‚Äôs a breakdown of the most commonly used Window Functions:

| Function          | Description                                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ROW_NUMBER       | Assigns a unique sequential integer to rows within a partition.                            |
| RANK             | Assigns a rank to rows in a partition, with gaps in ranking for ties.                      |
| DENSE_RANK       | Similar to RANK but without gaps in ranking for ties.                                       |
| NTILE            | Divides rows into a specified number of groups and assigns each row a group ID.            |
| LEAD and LAG     | Retrieve values from the next or previous row in a partition.                              |
| FIRST_VALUE      | Retrieves the first value in a partition.                                                  |
| LAST_VALUE       | Retrieves the last value in a partition.                                                   |

### Syntax üîß
Each Window Function is used with the `OVER` clause:

```sql
SELECT column_name,
       window_function() OVER ([PARTITION BY column_name] [ORDER BY column_name]) AS alias_name
FROM table_name;
```

---

### üí° Practical Examples

#### 1. ROW_NUMBER
Assign a unique number to each employee within their department:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id, salary,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS row_num
FROM employees;
```

#### 2. RANK and DENSE_RANK
Rank employees by salary within their department:

```sql
-- RANK Example
SELECT employee_id, department_id, salary,
       RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
FROM employees;

-- DENSE_RANK Example
SELECT employee_id, department_id, salary,
       DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS dense_rank
FROM employees;
```

#### 3. NTILE
Divide employees into 4 salary quartiles:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id, salary,
       NTILE(4) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary) AS quartile
FROM employees;
```

#### 4. LEAD and LAG
Retrieve the previous and next employee‚Äôs salary:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, salary,
       LAG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS prev_salary,
       LEAD(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) AS next_salary
FROM employees;
```

#### 5. FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE
Get the first and last salary in each department:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id, salary,
       FIRST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary) AS min_salary,
       LAST_VALUE(salary) OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND UNBOUNDED FOLLOWING) AS max_salary
FROM employees;
```

### üîß Best Practices
- **Use PARTITION BY Wisely**: Partition data meaningfully to get accurate results.
- **Optimize Performance**: Combine Window Functions with indexed columns to improve query speed.
- **Understand ROWS vs RANGE**: Be clear on how the window frame affects calculations.
- **Avoid Overlapping Calculations**: Reduce redundancy by minimizing the number of Window Functions in a query.

### üéØ Hands-On Challenge

1. Use ROW_NUMBER to identify the top 3 earners in each department.
2. Use RANK and DENSE_RANK to rank employees based on their performance scores.
3. Calculate a running total of sales using a Window Function.
4. Use LEAD and LAG to compare a product‚Äôs sales with its previous and next month‚Äôs performance.
5. Retrieve the first and last transaction amounts for each customer using FIRST_VALUE and LAST_VALUE.

### üíª Exercises - Day 16

#### ‚úÖ Exercise: Level 1
1. Write a query to assign row numbers to students in each class based on their grades.
2. Rank products by sales revenue within each category.
3. Retrieve the previous and next order amounts for each customer.

#### üöÄ Exercise: Level 2
